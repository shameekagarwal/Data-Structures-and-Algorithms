- stack - lifo (last in first out)
- e.g. when browsing web, note how back button works
- so, adding / removing items from the top is o(1)
- but adding / removing items from the bottom is o(n)
- e.g. if we use a linked list, push to / pop from head
  - implementing push and pop via head is both o(1)
  - implementing push on tail is o(1) but recall how pop would be o(n) (removing tail node in linked list is o(n))
- queue - fifo (first in first out)
- e.g. queue of people waiting for something
- we enqueue from one end and dequeue from another end
- e.g. if we use a linked list, dequeue from head but enqueue to tail
- note - understand how while can use array list to implement stacks, we cannot use 
- recall stacks are bad - they use vectors so synchronized so slower
- even linked lists are slow due to gs of nodes
- so, i am planning to always use ArrayDeque for everything
- probably remember `addLast`, `addFirst`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`, `peekFirst` `peekLast`, `isEmpty`
  - for emulating stacks - `addLast`, `removeLast`
  - for emulating queues - `addLast`, `removeFirst`

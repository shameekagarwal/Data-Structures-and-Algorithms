# Heaps

- also called a priority queue
- it is a complete binary tree - fills left from right without missing out positions
- can have duplicates
- max heap - max value at root - parent > = children
- we can also have a min heap
- we use an array to implement a heap
- because the tree is complete - there would not be any gaps in the array
- implementation - we can either leave the 0th index empty or not
- left child - `(2 * parent index) + 1`
- right child - `(2 * parent index) + 2`
- parent - `(index - 1) // 2`
- insertion - 
  - insert at end of array to keep the tree complete
  - keep bubbling up the current element while its value is greater than its parent
- remove - 
  - remove the beginning of the array
  - move the element at the end of the array to the beginning to keep the tree complete
  - keep bubbling down the current element while its value is lesser than its children
- height of binary tree - log(n) always, because it is always balanced / complete
- so, removing an item / inserting an item - both are log(n) always since tree is not skewed
- refer [Min Heap Implementation](./Min%20Heap%20Implementation.md) for complete implementation

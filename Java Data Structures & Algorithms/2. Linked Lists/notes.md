- can dynamically grow like array lists / unlike arrays
- however, elements cannot be accessed directly like array lists / array
- so, allocation of memory need not be contiguous?
- each node has a pointer pointing to the next node
- last pointer points to null
- head and tail can be maintained as well
- complexity (and comparison with array list where different) - 
  - adding to end - o(1)
  - removing from end - o(n) - o(1) in array list
  - adding to front - o(1) - o(n) in array list (requires reindexing every thing again)
  - removing from front - o(1) - o(n) in array list (requires reindexing every thing again)
  - adding in between - o(n)
  - removing from between - o(n)
  - look for a particular element by value - o(n)
  - look for a particular element by index - o(n) - o(1) in array list
- notes for interviews? - 
  - handle edge cases even meaningless ones - 
    - get(negative index)
    - get(greater than length)
  - reuse - set(index, value) in linked list can be implemented as get(index).value = value
- some optimizations for linked list - 
  - maintain last pointer
  - maintain length

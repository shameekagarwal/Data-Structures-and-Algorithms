# Introduction to Trees

- unlike arrays, linked lists, etc., follow hierarchical data structures
- binary tree - at max two children
- head / starting point - root
- children - whatever is beneath
- leaf - no children
- subtree - if we are standing at any node, treat it as the root, and it with its children becomes a subtree
- full binary tree - every node will have either 0 or 2 children
- complete binary tree 
  - all levels except last level should be completely filled
  - last level should be filled from left to right
- perfect binary tree - all leaf nodes are at last level only
- balanced binary tree - hight can be at a maximum of logN, where N is number of nodes. improves time complexity
- degenerate trees - also called skew trees - like a linked list

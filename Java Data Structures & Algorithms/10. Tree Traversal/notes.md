- tree traversal - visit all nodes in the tree
- two ways - bfs and dfs (3 different ways)
- bfs - level order traversal
  - we need queue (like a temporary buffer) and list (for actual results)
  - run the loop while the queue is non empty
- dfs - 
  - pre order - the node itself, left, right
  - post order - left, right, the node itself
  - in order - left, the node itself, right. final result is sorted automatically

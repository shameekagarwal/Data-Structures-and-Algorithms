# Graph and Types

- nodes / vertices
- edges
- undirected graph - has bidirectional edges
- directed graph - has unidirectional edges
- binary trees can also be called a graph
- a graph has a cycle if we can start and end at the same node
- question should mention specifically mention, e.g. undirected cyclic graph
- most common - dag - directed acyclic graph
- path - reachable nodes
- a node cannot appear twice in a path i.e. we cannot go 1-2-3-2-1
- degree of a node - number of edges that come inside / go outside of the node
- for an undirected graph - total degree of graph = 2 * number of edges - because each edge increments the degree of two nodes by 1
- edge can have weights as well
